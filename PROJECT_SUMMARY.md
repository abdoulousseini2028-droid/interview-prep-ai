### What Makes This Different

**vs. Tutorial Projects:**
- NOT a TODO app ❌
- NOT a Netflix clone ❌
- NOT a simple CRUD app ❌
- IS a unique, valuable tool ✅

**vs. Other Interview Prep:**
- LeetCode: Code only, no communication feedback
- Pramp: Requires scheduling, human reviewers

## 📊 Track These Metrics

After deployment, track:
- **Users**: Beta test with friends/classmates
- **Sessions**: Total practice attempts
- **Average Score**: Code quality ratings
- **Improvement**: Score delta over multiple attempts
- **Retention**: Do people come back?

Example resume bullet:
> "Built AI interview prep platform serving 50+ beta users, achieving 85% user retention and 40% average score improvement over 5 practice sessions"

## 🎤 Interview Talking Points

**Q: "Walk me through this project"**
> "I identified a gap in interview prep tools - they teach coding but not communication. I built a real-time platform using WebSocket for instant feedback and Claude AI for dual analysis: technical correctness AND explanation quality. The key innovation is simulating the actual interview experience, not just code validation."

**Q: "What was the hardest part?"**
> "Managing real-time, bidirectional communication while maintaining context across messages. I used FastAPI's async capabilities with WebSocket, structured the conversation state, and engineered prompts for consistent AI responses. The challenge was parsing unstructured AI output into actionable feedback."

**Q: "How would you scale this?"**
> "Current MVP handles 50+ concurrent users. For 1000+: PostgreSQL for persistence, Redis for caching, horizontal backend scaling with load balancer, CDN for frontend, and rate limiting per user. Total cost: ~$50-100/mo."

**Q: "What's the business model?"**
> "Freemium: 5 free sessions, then $9/mo unlimited. B2B licensing to bootcamps at $5/user. Enterprise tier with custom problems. Estimated $5-10 LTV per user, $2 CAC via content marketing."
