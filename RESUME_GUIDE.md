## 🔧 Technical Deep Dive

### Architecture Decision Records

**Why FastAPI over Flask?**
- Native async/await support for WebSocket
- Automatic API documentation (Swagger)
- Better performance for concurrent connections

**Why WebSocket over HTTP polling?**
- Real-time bidirectional communication
- Lower latency for feedback
- Better user experience

**Why Claude over GPT-4?**
- Longer context windows (200K tokens)
- Better at following system prompts
- More reliable structured outputs

### Performance Optimizations
- Code editor runs client-side (Monaco)
- WebSocket connection pooling
- Lazy loading of analysis results
- Optimistic UI updates

### Security Measures
- API key stored in environment variables
- Rate limiting per session
- Input sanitization
- CORS protection

## 📝 Interview Talking Points

**"Walk me through this project"**
> "I built an AI-powered interview prep platform that solves a problem I personally faced: existing platforms teach you to code, but not how to communicate solutions during interviews. The system uses WebSocket for real-time communication between React frontend and FastAPI backend. When users write code, Claude AI analyzes both the technical correctness and their explanation quality. The key innovation is the dual feedback system - you get instant insights on code complexity AND communication clarity."

**"What was the hardest technical challenge?"**
> "Implementing real-time, context-aware feedback. I needed to maintain conversation history across WebSocket messages, handle async AI requests without blocking, and parse unstructured AI responses into actionable feedback. I solved this by designing a structured prompt that requests JSON outputs, implementing fallback parsing, and using FastAPI's async features to handle concurrent sessions efficiently."

**"How does this demonstrate business value?"**
> "It addresses a $3B market where the main competitor (LeetCode) only solves half the problem. I validated the need through personal experience and research showing communication is the #1 interview failure reason. The MVP can be built and deployed in under 10 hours with minimal cost, making it highly scalable. Monetization paths include freemium model, B2B for bootcamps, and enterprise licensing."

**"What would you do differently?"**
> "For a production system, I'd add PostgreSQL for session persistence, implement user authentication, add Redis for caching, and build comprehensive analytics. I'd also conduct user research to validate assumptions and potentially pivot the feedback mechanism based on what users find most valuable."

## 🎤 30-Second Elevator Pitch

"I built an AI interview coach that most developers actually need. While LeetCode teaches you to code, my platform teaches you to explain your code like you're in a real interview. It uses WebSocket for instant feedback and Claude AI to evaluate both your technical solution and how well you communicate it. Built the MVP in 10 hours using FastAPI and React, and it's already solving the #1 reason people fail technical interviews: poor communication, not poor coding."
