# 🎯 AI Interview Prep Platform

A real-time coding interview practice platform that provides intelligent feedback on both **code quality** and **communication skills** using AI.

## 🚀 Why This Project Stands Out

- **Solves Real Pain**: LeetCode teaches coding, but not how to *communicate* solutions during interviews
- **Dual Feedback System**: Analyzes technical correctness AND interview communication
- **Production-Ready**: WebSocket streaming, error handling, session persistence
- **AI Integration**: Context-aware code review and interview simulation

## 🏗️ Architecture

```
Frontend (React + TypeScript)
    ↓
WebSocket Connection
    ↓
Backend (FastAPI + Python)
    ↓
AI Service (Claude API)
    ↓
Real-time Feedback Engine
```

## 📦 Tech Stack

**Frontend:**
- React 18 + TypeScript
- Monaco Editor (VS Code in browser)
- TailwindCSS for styling
- WebSocket for real-time communication

**Backend:**
- FastAPI (Python 3.11+)
- WebSocket support
- Anthropic Claude API
- SQLite for session storage

**Deployment:**
- Frontend: Vercel
- Backend: Railway/Render
- Database: SQLite → PostgreSQL (production)

## 🎯 Core Features

### MVP (10-hour build)
- [x] Live code editor with syntax highlighting
- [x] AI interviewer asks clarifying questions
- [x] Real-time code analysis feedback
- [x] Communication quality assessment
- [x] Session summary with improvements

### Future Enhancements
- Multiple language support
- Video recording of practice sessions
- Progress tracking dashboard
- Peer review mode
- Mock interview scheduling

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Backend Setup

```bash
cd backend
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Set your API key
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"

# Run the server
python main.py
```

Backend runs on `http://localhost:8000`

### Frontend Setup

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

Frontend runs on `http://localhost:5173`

## 🎨 Features Breakdown

### 1. Real-Time Code Analysis
- Syntax validation
- Time/space complexity analysis
- Best practices suggestions
- Security vulnerability detection

### 2. Interview Communication Feedback
- Clarity of explanation
- Problem-solving approach
- Edge case discussion
- Time management

### 3. AI Interviewer
- Contextual follow-up questions
- Hints when stuck
- Adaptive difficulty
- Natural conversation flow

### 4. Session Management
- Save practice sessions
- Review past attempts
- Track improvement metrics
- Export session reports

## 📊 Metrics & Impact

- **Users**: [Track beta users]
- **Sessions**: [Total practice sessions]
- **Avg. Improvement**: [Score delta over time]
- **Time Saved**: [Hours of mock interview prep]

## 🔐 Security & Privacy

- API keys stored in environment variables
- No code storage beyond session duration
- Session data encrypted at rest
- Rate limiting on API calls

## 🎯 Business Value

This platform addresses a $3B+ technical interview prep market where existing solutions focus only on coding skills, not communication—the #1 reason candidates fail technical interviews.

## 📝 Development Roadmap

**Week 1**: MVP with single language support (Python)
**Week 2**: Multi-language support, session persistence
**Week 3**: Analytics dashboard, improvement tracking
**Week 4**: Deployment, beta testing, user feedback
